              Beth began learning chess after noticing orphanage's custodian,
              Mr. Shaibel, playing alone, whereby she became fascinated with the
              checkered pattern of the eight-by-eight grid.

              Mr. Shaibel later on brings Mr. Ganz, the head of two local chess
              clubs, into the basement to face-off against Beth. After she
              defeats both of them after several games, even simultaneously, Mr.
              Ganz photographs Beth next to Mr. Shaibel to show her off to the

              through October which clues in Beth to ask for a job to obtain

              Beth discovered this tournament through Mrs. Wheatley, who
              initially took a solely monetary interest in chess, yet she grew
              fond of the art after watching Beth's games in this tournament. It
              was held at the then-Gibson Hotel in Cincinnati, Ohio.

              Played in 1963. According to a Chess Review magazine that Mrs.
              Wheatley reads on a plane, Beth wins against an unnamed
              Grandmaster in this tournament:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Schoolgirl beats Grandmaster in Pittsburgh. Onlookers were amazed
              at her youthful fine-points of strategy. She shows the assurance
              of a player twice her age.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Mrs. Wheatley promptly boasts that this counts as national
              recognition, to Beth's satisfaction.

              Played in December, starting on the twenty-sixth. Beth and Mrs.
              Wheatley discuss this tournament on a plane, musing over the
              convenience of travelling during the holidays.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a Chess Review magazine, Beth is referred to as a "wunderkind",
              meaning "wonder child" or child prodigy in German. Whether this is
              remark from a German person (and thus international recognition)
              is undisclosed.
            </p>

              Beth also determines that she should learn Russian during this

              Beth refused to shake Benny's hands prior to their final game. She
              lost against the Caro-Kann Defence, a noteworthy callback to their
              disagreement on its strength in 1963.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tournament was point-based; each win was one point, while each
              draw was a half-point. A loss meant no points. Benny won all of
              his games except two draws, whereas Beth won every game except one
              loss. This resulted in a tie. According to a newspaper article on
              Mr. Shaibel's wall, this was her first loss on record.

              Played in 1966, sometime in June (based on when Beth graduated two
              weeks prior). During the commentary of her games, Beth is said be
              to be seventeen years old. It was held at the Aztec Palace.
            </p>

              Beth plays against at least two international Grandmasters; GM
              Octavio Marenco, of Italy, and GM Vasily Borgov, of Russia. If
              Diedrich is also a Grandmaster from Austria, or if Georgi Girev is
              a Grandmaster of Russia, then this tournament may qualify as one
              of FIDE's International Master or Grandmaster norms. This may be
              evidence to Beth being a Grandmaster herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tournament appeared to be single-elimination; any player who
              loses is immediately eliminated from winning first prize. Beth
              most likely won a prize for second place, yet what this is
              monetarily is unclear.

              Beth plays the Rossolimo against GM Borgov, attempting to throw
